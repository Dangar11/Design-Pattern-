 ![Coordinator](Coordinator_Diagram.png)
 
 The coordinator pattern is a structural design pattern for organizing flow logic between view controllers. It involves these components:
 
 1. The **Coordinator** is a protocol that defines methods and properties all concrete coordinators must implement. Specifically, it defines relationship properties, `children` and `router`, and presentation methods, `present` and `dismiss`.
 
 2. The **Concrete Coordinator** implements the coordinator protocol. It knows how to create concrete view controllers and the order that view controllers should be displayed.
 
 3. The **Router** is a protocol that defines methods all concrete routers must implement. Specifically, it defines `present` and `dismiss` methods for showing and dismissing view controllers.
 
 4. The **Concrete Router** knows how to present view controllers, but it doesn't know what exactly is being presented or which view controller will be presented next.
 
 5. The **Concrete View Controllers** are your typical `UIViewController` subclasses found in MVC. However, they _don't_ know about other view controllers. Instead, they delegate to the coordinator whenever a transition needs to performed.
 
 ## Code Example
 */

import PlaygroundSupport
import UIKit

/* 1.First create homeViewController, and then use this to create
 navigationController. This will be the "home" screen. If this were actually an iOS
 app instead, this would be the first screen shown whenever the app is launched.*/

let homeViewController = HomeViewController.instantiate()
let navigationController = UINavigationController(rootViewController: homeViewController)

/* 2.You then create the router using the navigationController, and in turn, create the
 coordinator using the router.*/
let router = ConcreateRouter(navigationController: navigationController)
let coordinator = HowToCodeCoordinator(router: router)

/* 3. open HomeViewController.swift, youâ€™ll see it has a single button that
 ultimately calls its onButtonPressed closure. You here set
 homeViewController.onButtonPressed to tell the coordinator to present, which
 will start its flow.*/
homeViewController.onButtonPressed = { [weak coordinator] in
  coordinator?.present(animated: true, onDismissed: nil)
}
