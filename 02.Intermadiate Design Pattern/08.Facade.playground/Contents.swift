 ![Multicast Delegate Diagram](Facade_Diagram.png)
 
 The facade pattern is a structural pattern that provides a simple interface to a complex system. It involves two types:
 
 1. The **facade** provides simple methods to interact with the system. This allows consumers to use the facade instead of knowing about and interacting with multiple classes in the system.
 
 2. The **dependencies** are objects owned by the facade. Each dependency performs a small part of a complex task.
